# Hi, I’m Nathan 👋

I’m a software engineer focused on **Python-based data extraction, analysis, and decision-support tooling**.

My work is focused on turning messy, hard-to-access public data into **clear, usable signals** — whether that’s for validating ideas, understanding market behavior, or supporting production systems.

---

## What I Work On

- **Data extraction & scraping**
  - API-first pipelines (HN, Reddit, public datasets)
  - HTML parsing with resilience to layout changes
  - Rate-limiting, retries, and failure-tolerant design

- **Analysis & decision support**
  - Rule-based classifiers and explainable scoring systems
  - “Is this actually happening?” validation work
  - Converting qualitative noise into quantitative signal

- **Data pipelines & reporting**
  - Python, pandas, CSV/JSON outputs
  - SQL querying and reporting
  - Clean, auditable transformations

- **Production-minded engineering**
  - Maintainability over cleverness
  - Explicit assumptions and tradeoffs
  - Systems designed to fail gracefully

---

## Current Focus

- Lightweight validation pipelines for founders and operators  
- Identifying real-world behavior from public technical communities  
- Building reusable, modular scraping and analysis tools  

I’m particularly interested in work that sits **upstream of product decisions**, where clarity is more valuable than features.

## Professional Context

I currently work as a Software Engineer at a large regulated utility, where I support and enhance production systems used at scale. The role emphasizes reliability, careful change management, and translating business requirements into maintainable technical solutions.

That experience strongly influences how I approach side projects and tooling: clear assumptions, defensive design, and a focus on long-term operability over novelty.

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Data:** pandas, CSV/JSON workflows  
- **Scraping:** requests, BeautifulSoup, Playwright  
- **APIs:** REST, pagination, rate-limited systems  
- **Infra mindset:** logging, retries, backoff, explainability

## How I Think About Problems

- Evidence beats intuition  
- Behavior matters more than opinions  
- Small, well-scoped tools outperform large abstractions  
- If a system can’t explain *why* it produced an output, it’s not finished
